If you have followed these steps, the code should work without any issues.

Remember: The objects you want to act as CheckPoints should have the "box collider" property set to "is trigger." Additionally, these objects should have the tag "CheckPoint" selected.


"After collecting the CheckPoints, you can teleport by pressing the R key."
